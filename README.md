Code to detect allele specific binding (ASB) of RNA binding proteins (RBP) to RNA from pooled (from multiple individuals) RNA immunoprecipation & sequencing (RIP-seq) data. 

Analysis pipeline is in /src. Underlying code is in the package /src/poolQTL. 

Data required to run is located in /data

Results generated by each model can be found in the /results directory

Due to restrictions on human subjects data, WGS information cannot be shared for the cell lines used to generate this data, however, a list of heterozygous SNPs is included in /het_snps.txt.
